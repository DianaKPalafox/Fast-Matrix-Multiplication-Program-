# Fast-Matrix-Multiplication-Program-


1. Using Tiling, reordering, and prefeching to optimize te matrix. 
2. We have the following documents the Makfile to make and benchmark
3. benchmark.c: It check results and produce performance numbers dgemm-naive.c: na√Øve implementation
4. dgemm-optimize.c: The optimization code using the following tiling, reordering, and prefeching.

:)
