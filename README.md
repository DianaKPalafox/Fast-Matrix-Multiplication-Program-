# Fast-Matrix-Multiplication-Program-


*Using Tiling, reordering, and prefeching to optimize te matrix. 
*We have the following documents the Makfile to make and benchmark
*benchmark.c: It check results and produce performance numbers dgemm-naive.c: na√Øve implementation
*dgemm-optimize.c: The optimization code using the following tiling, reordering, and prefeching.
